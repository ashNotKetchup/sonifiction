Sonifiction is a platform for speculating with and about sound. This includes:

- Fiction about sound
- Sonic interaction design
- Experimental, interactive multimedia

We believe in indisciplinarity, work in progress, and showing rather than telling. If you have something you'd like to contribute to our [blog](/blog), please [get in touch!]()
